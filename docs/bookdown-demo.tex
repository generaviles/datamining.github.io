\chapter{Principal Components Analysis}\label{intro}

\section{What does PCA do?}\label{what-does-pca-do}

This methods tries to explain the correlation structure of a set of
predictor variables using a smaller set o linear combinations of these
variables called \textbf{\emph{components}}, note that \emph{components}
are not variables, rather indicators of linear combinations between
variables. Given a dataset with \(m\) variables a set of \(k\) linear
combinations can be used to represent it (meaning that \(k\) contains
almost as much information as the \(m\) variables), also \(k<<m\).

\section{PCA Step by Step}\label{pca-step-by-step}

\subsection{1. Getting the dataset and things
ready.}\label{getting-the-dataset-and-things-ready.}

Before starting the process of dimensionality reduction one should make
sure the data is standardized, this is done to avoid bised in the
results by values to large or to small when compared to each other.

\subsection{2. Centering the points}\label{centering-the-points}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{standardization process} is acomplished when the mean for
  each variable \(=0\) and the standard deviation \(=1\). The following
  formula can be followed to acomplish this process:
  \[Z_i = \frac {(X_i-\mu_i)}{\sigma_{ii}}\]
\end{itemize}

Where: \(\mu_i\) equals the mean of \(X_i\) and \(\sigma_{ii}\) equals
the standard deviation of \(X_i\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the values are given as a set of points the process can be
  acomplished with the following formula:
\end{itemize}

\[x_{i,a} = x_{i,a} - \mu_a\]

This move will facilitate the calculations down the road.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{3. Compute covariance (\(\sigma_{X,Y}\))
matrix}{3. Compute covariance (\textbackslash{}sigma\_\{X,Y\}) matrix}}\label{compute-covariance-sigma_xy-matrix}

The \textbf{covariance} is a measure of the degree to which two
variables vary together. Positive covariance indicates that when one
variable increases, the other tends to increase. Negative covariance
indicates that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
The covariance measure \textbf{is not scaled}.

In a \(2x2\) matrix: \[\begin{vmatrix}
2.0 & 0.8 \\
0.8 & 0.6
\end{vmatrix}\]

Since the mean (\(\mu\)) is equal to \(\emptyset\) thanks to
\emph{centering} the values in the previous step, the formula to
calculate the covariance of the values in the matrix is:
\[cov(x_1,x_2) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i,j}x_{i,2}\] \textbf{The
way to interpret \emph{covariance} is to understand it's results as
information about how one attribute changes as the other one changes.}

It is important to remember that, if we multiply a vector by the
covariance matrix or \(\sum\) the resulting vector will turn towards the
direction of the variance.

Changing the units of measure would change the results, this is an
inconvenience and is addressed by calculating the
\textbf{\emph{correlation coefficient \(r_{ij}\)}}:

\(r_{ij}\) scales the covariance by each of the standard deviations:
\[r_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}^2}{\sigma_{ii} \sigma_{jj}}\] \textbf{The
\(r_{ij}\) gives us a value with reference to know how much of a
correlation exists between two variables.}

\subsection{4. Eigenvectors +
Eigenvalues}\label{eigenvectors-eigenvalues}

Define a \textbf{new set of dimentions} by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Taking the dataset and looking for the direction of the data, looking
  to draw a line in which, along it, there is the \textbf{greatest
  amount of variance \(\sigma^2\)} in the data, this line will be called
  the \textbf{principal component 1 (PC1)}.
\end{enumerate}

\[\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(X-\mu)^2}{N}\space \space  \text{or}\space \space \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum X^2}{N} - \mu^2\]
\emph{In the previous formula \(\sigma^2\) is defined as the sum of the
squared distances of each term in the distribution from the mean
(\(\mu^2\)) divided by the number of terms in the distribution (\(N\)).
In simple words: \(\sigma^2\) measures \textbf{how far a set of random
numbers are spread out from their mean}.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Once PC1 is determined, it will established the next dimension by
  drawing an \textbf{\emph{orthogonal}} (perpendicular) line in relation
  to PC1, the exact area where the line will be drawn is determined by
  the same process of finding the gratest \(\sigma^2\) of the remaining
  data, once this is done PC2 is ready.
\item
  This will be done iteratively until all the dimensions (\(d\)) of the
  dataset are covered and components (\(m\)) are generated for every
  single \(d\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first \(m<<d\) components become \(m\) new dimensions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Coordinates from every datapoint will be changed to these ``new''
    dimensions.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Greatest variability} is pursued to maintain the
  \href{https://rpubs.com/generaviles/248692}{\emph{smoothness}}
  assumption of dimensions.
\end{itemize}

 Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are mathematically expressed as:

\[A \overrightarrow{v} = \lambda \overrightarrow{v}\] Where \(A\)
represents \emph{transformation}, \(\overrightarrow{v}\), a vector, also
known as \textbf{eigenvector}, that comes out of the matrix being
analysied and \(\lambda\), a scalar value also known as
\textbf{eigenvalue}.

\textbf{Principal components = eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues.}

\subsubsection{Finding Eigenvalues and
Eigenvectors}\label{finding-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors}

In order to exemplify the process of finding these values and vector
steps are presented for a \(2x2\) matrix, but this can be done with any
matrix of \(n\space x\space n\) dimensions following the rules of matrix
algebra.

To begin with the example we will declare a matrix:
\[A =  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
7 & 3 \\
3 & -1  \end{array} \right]\]

Now the steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Multiply an \(n\space x\space n\) identity matrix by the
  scalar \(\lambda\): \(IA\lambda\)} \[\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1  \end{array} \right] * \lambda = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  \lambda & 0 \\
  0 & \lambda  \end{array} \right]\]
\item
  \textbf{Substract the identity matrix multiple from matrix A:
  \(A-\lambda I\)} \[\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  7 & 3 \\
  3 & -1  \end{array} \right] - \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1  \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  7-\lambda & 3 \\
  3 & -1-\lambda  \end{array} \right]\]
\item
  \textbf{Find the determinant of the matrix obtained in previous step:
  \(det(A-\lambda I)\)} \[ det\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  7-\lambda & 3 \\
  3 & -1-\lambda  \end{array} \right] = (7-\lambda)(-1-\lambda)-(3*3)\]
  \[= - 7 - 7 \lambda + \lambda + \lambda^2 = -16-6\lambda + \lambda^2\]
  \[= \lambda^2 - 6\lambda -16\]
\item
  \textbf{Solve for the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the equation
  \(det(A-\lambda I)=0\)} Solving for \(\lambda^2 - 6\lambda -16 = 0\)
  will result in: \[(\lambda-8)(\lambda+2)=0\] Therfore
  \(\lambda_1 = 8\) and \(\lambda_2 = -2\) \textbf{these are the
  eigenvalues for matrix \(A\).} 
\item
  \textbf{Solve for the corresponding vector to each \(\lambda\)}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solving for }\(\lambda = 8\)\textbf{, in this process we will
call the matrix with substituted values: \(B\).}

\[ \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
7-(8) & 3 \\
3 & -1-(8)  \end{array} \right] =  \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 3 \\
3 & -9  \end{array} \right]\]

We will assume the following \(B \overline X = 0 \space \therefore\)

\[\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 3 \\
3 & -9  \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
0 \\
0 \end{array} \right]\]

Applying row reduction \(3R_1 + R_2 = R_2\) to:
\[\left[ \begin{array}{cc|r}
-1 & 3 & 0\\
3 & -9 & 0  \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc|r}
-1 & 3 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0  \end{array} \right] \space \therefore -x_1+3x_2 = 0\]

From the previous operation we obtain \(3x_2 = x_1\), at this point we
can choose a value for any \(x\), we will go for \(x_2 = 1\) to keep it
simple.

\[3x_2 = x_1 \space \therefore 3(1) = x_1 \space \therefore \space x_1 = 3\]

\textbf{Now we know that the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 8\) \$ corresponds
to the eigenvector \(\overline X = (3,1)\).}

\textbf{Solving for \(\lambda -2\), generating matrix \(C\).}
\[C = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
7-(-2) & 3 \\
3 & -1-(-2)  \end{array} \right]\]
\(C\overline X = 0 \space \therefore\)

\[\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
9 & 3 \\
3 & 1  \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2  \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
0 \\
0  \end{array} \right]\]

Applying row reduction \(3R_2 - R_1 = R_1\):

\[\left[ \begin{array}{cc|r}
0 & 0 & 0\\
3 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right] \space \therefore 3x_1 + x_2 = 0\]

Assigning \(x_1 = 1\): \[x_2 = -3x_1 \space \therefore x_2 = -3(1)\]

\textbf{The eigenvalue \(\lambda = 8\) corresponds to the eigenvector
\(\overline X = (1,-3)\)}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{5. Pick \(m<d\) eigenvectors with highest
eigenvalues.}{5. Pick m\textless{}d eigenvectors with highest eigenvalues.}}\label{pick-md-eigenvectors-with-highest-eigenvalues.}

In other words, usually the \textbf{2} eigenvectors with the highest
scalars, or \(\lambda\), will be selected to represent the whole dataset
as \emph{Principal Component 1} and \emph{Principal Component 2}.

\subsection{6. Project datapoints to those
eigenvectors.}\label{project-datapoints-to-those-eigenvectors.}

One or the algoritm has to project the datapoints to these new set of
dimensions so they can be analyized.

\subsection{7. Perform analysis as needed according to
study.}\label{perform-analysis-as-needed-according-to-study.}

\section{Pros and Cons of PCA}\label{pros-and-cons-of-pca}

This algorithm, as all, is better suited for specific circumstances and
performs poorly in others. The following list trys to summarize this
idea:

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Pros}}{Pros}}\label{pros}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reduction in size of data.
\item
  Allows estimation of probabilites in high-dimensional data.
\item
  It renders a set of components that are uncorrelated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Cons}}{Cons}}\label{cons}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It has a high computational cost, therefore it cannot be applied to
  very large datasets.
\item
  Not good when working with fine-grained classes.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Canonical Correlation Analysis
(CCA)}\label{canonical-correlation-analysis-cca}

\section{What is CCA?}\label{what-is-cca}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Seeks the weighted linear composit for each variate (sets of D.V. or
  I.V.) to maximize the overlap in their distributions.
\item
  Labeling of DV and IV is arbitrary. The procedure looks for
  relationships and not causation.
\item
  Goal is to \textbf{maximize the correlation} (not the variance
  extracted as in most other techniques).
\item
  Lacks specificity in interpreting results, that may limit its
  usefulness in many situations.
\end{itemize}

CCA helps us answer the questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{What is the best way to understand how the variables in
  two sets are related? }}, mathematically speaking:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{what linear combinations of the set \(X\) variables
    (\(u\)) and the set Y variables (\(t\)) will maximize their
    correlation?}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Canonical R (\textbf{\(R_c\)})
}{Canonical R (R\_c)  }}\label{canonical-r-r_c}

It represents the overlapping variance between two variates which are
linear composites of each set of variables.

\section{Assumptions for CCA}\label{assumptions-for-cca}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiple continuous variables for DVs and IVs or categorical with
  dummy coding.
\item
  Assumes \textbf{linear relationship} between any two variables and
  between variates.
\item
  Multivariate normality is necessary to perform CCA.
\item
  Multicollinearity in either variate \textbf{confounds} interpretation
  of canonical results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives of CCA}\label{objectives-of-cca}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Determine the magnitude of the relationships that may existe between
  two sets of variables.
\item
  Derive a variate(s) for each set of criterion and predictor variables
  such that the variate(s) of each set is maximally correlated.
\item
  Explain the nature of whatever relationships exist between the sets of
  criterion and predictor variables.
\item
  Seek the max correlation of shared variance between the two sides of
  the equation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Terms used in the context of a CCA
analysis}\label{terms-used-in-the-context-of-a-cca-analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Canonical correlation:} Correlation between two sets; the
  largest possible correlation that can be found between linear
  combinations.
\item
  \textbf{Canonical variate:} The linear combinations created from the
  IV set and DV set.
\item
  \textbf{Canonical weights:} weights used to create the liniear
  combinations; interpreted like regression coefficients.
\item
  \textbf{Canonical loadings:} correlations between each variable and
  its variate; interpreted like loadings in PCA.
\item
  \textbf{Canonical cross-loadings:} Correlation of each observed
  independent or dependent variable with \emph{opposite} canonical
  variate.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interpreting canonical
variates}\label{interpreting-canonical-variates}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Canonical weights

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    larger wight contributes more to the function.
  \item
    negative weight indicates an inverse relationship with other
    variables.
  \item
    always look out for multicollinearity, it can skew the whole
    analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Canonical Loadings.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A direct assessment of each variable´s contribution to its
    respective canonical variate.
  \item
    Larger loadings are interpreted as more important to deriving the
    canonical variate.
  \item
    Correlation between the original variable and its canonoical
    variate.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Canonical Cross-Loadings

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Measure of correlation of each original D.V. with the independent
    canonical variate.
  \item
    Direct assessment of the relationship between each D.V. and the
    independent variate.
  \item
    Provides a more pure measure of the dependent and independent
    variable relationship.
  \item
    Preferred approach to interpretation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Considerations when working with
CCA}\label{considerations-when-working-with-cca}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small samples sizes may have an adverse effect.
\item
  Suggested minimun sample size = 10 * \# of values.
\item
  Selection of variables to be included:
\item
  Select them with domain knowledge or theoretical basis.
\item
  Inclusion of irrelevant or deletion of relevant variables may
  adversely affect the entire canonical solution.
\item
  All I.V.s must be interrelated and all D.V.s must be interrelated.
\item
  Composition of D.V. and I.V. variates is critical to producing
  practical results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations of CCA}\label{limitations-of-cca}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(R_c\) (canonical R) reflects only the variance shared by the linear
  composites, not the variances extracted from the variables.
\item
  Canonical weights are subject to a great deal of instability,
  particularly when there is multicollinearity.
\item
  Interpretation difficult because rotation is not possible.
\item
  Precise statistics have not been developed to interpret canonical
  analysis.
\end{itemize}

This chapter is under construction.

\section{Other names:}\label{other-names}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM).
\item
  Kohonen Map.
\item
  Kohonen Networks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Generalities}\label{generalities}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{S}elf \textbf{O}rganizing \textbf{M}aps belong to the family
  of \textbf{Artificial Neural Networks}.
\item
  In the subgroup of \textbf{Unsupervised Learning},
\item
  To function they use a \textbf{competitive learning strategy} (winer
  takes all).
\item
  They are considered to be a \textbf{non-linear} implementation of the
  \emph{Principal Components Analysis} (PCA) algorithm. 
\end{itemize}

Self Organizing Maps (SOM) where first described by Teuvo Kohonen
\citep{kohonen1995self}, others have extended his work and modified SOMs
to tackle speficif problems.

``The Self-Organizing Map is inspired by postulated feature maps of
neurons in the brain comprised of feature-sensitive cells that provide
ordered projections between neuronal layers, such as those that may
exist in the retina and cochlea. For example, there are acoustic feature
maps that respond to sounds to which an animal is most frequently
exposed, and tonotopic maps that may be responsible for the order
preservation of acoustic resonances.'' \citep{brownlee2011clever}
Different sensory inputs are maped into corresponding areas of the
cerebral cortex in an orderly way. The \emph{map} generated in the
cerebral cortex is called a \textbf{topographic map} and it has two very
important properties, \citep{somFundamentals}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  At each stage of representation, or processing, each piece of incoming
  information is kept in its proper context/neighbourhood.
\item
  Neurons dealing with closely related pieces of information are kept
  close together so that they can interact via short synaptic
  connections.
\end{enumerate}

Following the principles observed in the sensory input processing by
neurological structures , the previous two properties should be kept in
an artificial intelligence algorithm looking to reproduce this
phenomenon. In shorter words: the principle of topographic map formation
is the escence of this process, where:

\begin{quote}
``The spatial location of an output neuron in a topographic map
corresponds to a particular domain or feature drawn from the input
space.'' \citep{somFundamentals}
\end{quote}
