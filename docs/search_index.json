Seeks the weighted linear composit for each variate (sets of D.V. or I.V.) to maximize the overlap in their distributions. Labeling of DV and IV is arbitrary. The procedure looks for relationships and not causation. Goal is to maximize the correlation (not the variance extracted as in most other techniques). Lacks specificity in interpreting results, that may limit its usefulness in many situations. CCA helps us answer the questions: What is the best way to understand how the variable sin two sets are related? , mathematically speaking: what linear combinations of the \\(X\\) variables (\\(u\\)) and the Y variables (\\(t\\)) will maximize their correlation? \\(R_c\\) It represents the overlapping variance between two variates which are linear composites of each set of variables. 3.2 Assumptions for CCA Multiple continuous variables for DVs and IVs or categorical with dummy coding. Assumes linear relationship between any two variables and between variates. Multivariate normality is necessary to perform CCA. Multicollinearity in either variate confounds interpretation of canonical results. This chapter is under construction. "]
