# Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

##What is CCA?

  - Seeks the weighted linear composit for each variate (sets of D.V. or I.V.) to maximize the overlap in their distributions.
  - Labeling of DV and IV is arbitrary. The procedure looks for relationships and not causation.
  - Goal is to **maximize the correlation** (not the variance extracted as in most other techniques).
  - Lacks specificity in interpreting results, that may limit its usefulness in many situations.

CCA helps us answer the questions:<br \>

  - ***What is the best way to understand how the variable sin two sets are related? ***,
mathematically speaking:
    - ***what linear combinations of the $X$ variables ($u$) and the Y variables ($t$) will maximize their correlation?***
    

**$R_c$** <br \>
It represents the overlapping variance between two variates which are linear composites of each set of variables.

##Assumptions for CCA

  - Multiple continuous variables for DVs and IVs or categorical with dummy coding.
  - Assumes **linear relationship** between any two variables and between variates.
  - Multivariate normality is necessary to perform CCA.
  - Multicollinearity in either variate **confounds** interpretation of canonical results.
