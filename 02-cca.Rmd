# Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

##What is CCA?

  - Seeks the weighted linear composit for each variate (sets of D.V. or I.V.) to maximize the overlap in their distributions.
  - Labeling of DV and IV is arbitrary. The procedure looks for relationships and not causation.
  - Goal is to **maximize the correlation** (not the variance extracted as in most other techniques).
  - Lacks specificity in interpreting results, that may limit its usefulness in many situations.

CCA helps us answer the questions:<br \>

  - ***What is the best way to understand how the variables in two sets are related? ***,
mathematically speaking:
    - ***what linear combinations of the set $X$ variables ($u$) and the set Y variables ($t$) will maximize their correlation?***
    

###Canonical R (**$R_c$**) <br \>
It represents the overlapping variance between two variates which are linear composites of each set of variables.

##Assumptions for CCA

  - Multiple continuous variables for DVs and IVs or categorical with dummy coding.
  - Assumes **linear relationship** between any two variables and between variates.
  - Multivariate normality is necessary to perform CCA.
  - Multicollinearity in either variate **confounds** interpretation of canonical results.

##Objectives of CCA

  - Determine the magnitude of the relationships that may existe between two sets of variables.
  - Derive a variate(s) for each set of criterion and predictor variables such that the variate(s) of each set is maximally correlated.
  - Explain the nature of whatever relationships exist between the sets of criterion and predictor variables.
  - Seek the max correlation of shared variance between the two sides of the equation.

##Terms used in the context of a CCA analysis

  - **Canonical correlation:** Correlation between two sets; the largest possible correlation that can be found between linear combinations.
  - **Canonical variate:** The linear combinations created from the IV set and DV set.
  - **Canonical weights:** weights used to create the liniear combinations; interpreted like regression coefficients.
  - **Canonical loadings:** correlations between each variable and its variate; interpreted like loadings in PCA.
  - **Canonical cross-loadings:** Correlation of each observed independent or dependent variable with *opposite* canonical variate.

##Interpreting canonical variates

  - Canonical weights
    - larger wight contributes more to the function.
    - negative weight indicates an inverse relationship with other variables.
    - always look out for multicollinearity, it can skew the whole analysis.
  - Canonical Loadings.
    - A direct assessment of each variableÂ´s contribution to its respective canonical variate.
    - Larger loadings are interpreted as more important to deriving the canonical variate.
    - Correlation between the original variable and its canonoical variate.
  - Canonical Cross-Loadings
    - Measure of correlation of each original D.V. with the independent canonical variate.
    - Direct assessment of the relationship between each D.V. and the independent variate.
    - Provides a more pure measure of the dependent and independent variable relationship.
    - Preferred approach to interpretation.

##Considerations when working with CCA

- Small samples sizes may have an adverse effect.
  - Suggested minimun sample size = 10 * # of values.
- Selection of variables to be included:
  - Select them with domain knowledge or theoretical basis.
  - Inclusion of irrelevant or deletion of relevant variables may adversely affect the entire canonical solution.
  - All I.V.s must be interrelated and all D.V.s must be interrelated.
  - Composition of D.V. and I.V. variates is critical to producing practical results.

##Limitations of CCA

- $R_c$ (canonical R) reflects only the variance shared by the linear composites, not the variances extracted from the variables.
- Canonical weights are subject to a great deal of instability, particularly when there is multicollinearity.
- Interpretation difficult because rotation is not possible.
- Precise statistics have not been developed to interpret canonical analysis.
